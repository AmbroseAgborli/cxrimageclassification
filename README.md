# PNEUMONIA DETECTION FROM CHEST X – RAYS USING CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK

Disease Diagnosis from an image is one of the challenging problems faced in today’s world. Due to the ever-increasing population growth the doctors must overwork for meeting the needs of the patients. Hence an early diagnostic system which can detect the disease in the early stages is helpful for doctors. Such a disease is Pneumonia which occurs in the lungs due to the bacterial infection. The early diagnosis and subsequent treatment can help in certainly reducing the deaths caused due to this disease. The Symptoms of this disease can be detected using a Chest X-Ray. The diagnosis subjected to this disease can be sometimes unclear and hence creates dilemma in detection of disease. Hence in this study we propose a Convolutional Neural Network based model for the detection of pneumonia so that it may assist the doctors in early detection
